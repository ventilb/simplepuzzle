# Simple Puzzle game
This project is a very simple puzzle game. It loads an image into a JFrame creates equal sized tiles from it. By
clicking the mouse on a tile you can move a tile around if any neighbour cell is empty.

I have developed this program to evaluate if it could give enough work to keep a trainee at my work busy.
